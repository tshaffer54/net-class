# The Story about Ping

Implement a *ping* application using ICMP request and reply messages. You have to use Python's *RAW* sockets to properly send ICMP messages. You should complete the provided ping application so that it sends 5 Echo requests to each RIR (ARIN, RIPE, LACNIC, AFRINIC, APNIC), 1 request every second. Each message contains a payload of data that includes a timestamp. After sending each packet, the application waits up to one second to receive a reply. If the one-second timer expires, assume the packet is lost or the server is down. Report the following statistics for each host:

* packet loss
* maximum round-trip time
* minimum RTT
* average RTT
* RTT standard deviation

## Code notes

You need to receive the structure ICMP_ECHO_REPLY and fetch the information you need, such as checksum, sequence number, time to live (TTL), etc.

This application requires the use of raw sockets. You may need administrator/root privileges to run your program.

When running this application as a root, make sure to use `python3`.

### Functions

* `print_raw_bytes`: auxiliary function, useful for debugging. Takes (received) *packet bytes* as an argument. **Can be used without modifications**

* `checksum`: calculates packet checksum. Takes *packet bytes* as an argument. **Can be used without modifications**

* `parse_reply`: receives and parses an echo reply. Takes the following arguments: *socket*, *request id*, *timeout*, and the *destination address*. Returns a tuple of the *destination address*, *packet size*, *roundtrip time*, *time to live*, and *sequence number*. You need to modify lines between labels **TODO** and **DONE**. This function should raise an error if the response message type, code, or checksum are incorrect.

* `format_request`: formats echo request. Takes *request id* and *sequence number* as arguments. **Can be used without modifications**

* `send_request`: creates a socket and uses sends a message prepared by `format_request`. **Can be used without modifications**

* `ping`: main loop. Takes a *destination host*, *number of packets to send*, and *timeout* as arguments. Displays host statistics. You need to modify lines between labels **TODO** and **DONE**.
